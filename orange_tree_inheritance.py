# You should be able to measure the height of the tree.
# You should be able to find out if the tree is dead.
# Each year, the tree should age by 1 year (it becomes older and taller, and eventually dies).
# A tree grows 1 meter per year until it is 10 years old. Then it stops growing.
# The orange tree cannot die until it reaches 50 years old.
# After 50 years, the probability of dying increases each year.
# No tree can live more than 100 years.
# A tree will produce 100 fruits a year once it is more than 5 years old.
# A tree will produce 200 fruits a year when it reaches 10 years old.
# A tree will not produce fruits once it reaches 15 years old.
# You should be able to pick a single fruit from the tree by calling the pick_a_fruit! method on your tree (but only if there are some left).
# At the end of each year, the fruits which have not been picked will fall off.
# You should be able to find out how many fruits are left hanging on the tree.
